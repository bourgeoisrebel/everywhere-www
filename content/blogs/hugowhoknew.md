## First steps in to the world of building a small company website

*the hardest part of the journey is always the first step*

Creating a website is one of those things that was on the to-do list for a long time, but never quite made it to the top. Work comes via networking, word of mouth and contacts built up over time, so while a modern company needs a public face, it has always been a job for maÃ±ana. Using something like Wix when you work in IT feels like cheating, but there is a bewildering number of options for creating and hosting websites on the market, making it hard to know where to start. However a recent client had a requirement to build a *living documentation* web site using a framework called __Hugo__, so this presented an opportunity to dive in and skill up, ___fast___, with a view to applying the approach to this company website.

Microsoft recently introduced __Aure Static Websites__, a free (in preview) lightwieght service that automatically builds and deploys web apps to Azure from a GitHub repo, making it free and easy to get started with hosting your own website.
