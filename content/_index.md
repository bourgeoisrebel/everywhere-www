**Overview**
---
Bill Gates famously started the process of democratising the world of computing in the 1980's, promising to bring computers in to every home and office. Now there is a sophisticated computer in every pocket, and so may aspects of our homes and lives are managed using AI and smart devices, from home security systems to lights and heating. Hosting has moved from physical data centres managed by organisations to massive data centres hosted and managed by providers such as Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle. This provides security, economies of scale, and a platform the facilitates agile development, paying for what is used and scalable as an organisation's requirements change. It is always up to date, and easier to maintain than traditional data centres, so with the hosting platform managing the underlying infrastructure businesses can concentrate on their customers.
